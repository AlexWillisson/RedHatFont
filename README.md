# Red Hat Fonts Files

How our words look is as important to our brand voice as the words we choose. That’s why we developed a type family that’s all our own.
Red Hat Display is made for headlines and big statements. It’s an embodiment of our brand’s personality—open, straightforward, rational—but friendly and approachable, too.
Red Hat Display comes in four weights, each with italics.  
Because we’re Red Hat, we aren’t keeping our font to ourselves. Like Liberation and Overpass, Red Hat Display is an open source font under the SIL license, and is available for anyone to use.

Red Hat Text takes all that personality and optimizes it for more demanding applications. It’s more condensed and has more space around each letter, so that it’s easy to read in paragraphs, like a whitepaper, or at small sizes, like a tooltip in an interface.
Red Hat Text comes in three weights, each with italics.
Red Hat Text is an open source font under the SIL license, and is available for anyone to use.
