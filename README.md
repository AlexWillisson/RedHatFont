## About Red Hat Display and Red Hat Text

How our words look is as important to our brand voice as the words we choose.
That’s why we developed a type family that’s all our own.

Red Hat is an enterprise software company with an open source development model. We use collaboration and knowledge sharing to craft better, more reliable, and more adaptable technologies.

Red Hat Display is made for headlines and big statements. It’s an embodiment of
our brand’s personality—open, straightforward, rational—but friendly and
approachable, too.

Red Hat Display comes in four weights, each with italics.

Because we’re Red Hat, we aren’t keeping our work to ourselves. Like Liberation
and Overpass, Red Hat Display is an open source font under the SIL license, and
is available for anyone to use.

Red Hat Text takes all that personality and optimizes it for more demanding
applications. It’s more condensed and has more space around each letter, so that
it’s easy to read in paragraphs, like a whitepaper, or at small sizes, like a tooltip in
an interface.

Red Hat Text comes in three weights, each with italics.

Red Hat Text is also an open source font under the SIL license, and is available for
anyone to use.
